### Portfolio README


#### Overall Concept

The main goal was to create something that mirrors my personality and showcases my work effectively. I am an artist and it was important for me to show that throughout the portfolio, especially since I don't have any other from-scratch projects that showcase my style yet. It was important that this portfolio felt like me. 



#### Color and Styling.

The color scheme was chosen to resonate with my style while also keeping the contrast high with the thought of accessibility in mind. The gradual gradient in the Technologies section adds a dynamic visual element and all the other gradient you see from top to bottom is actually images of my previous embroidery art blurred, faded and made to be gradients to add interest + a way to break up sections smoothly while not being too much or too harsh, I wanted this page to flow. 
My design choice was centered around a clean and modern layout, opting to use styled components for easy and maintainable development. I aimed for a minimalist yet visually appealing interface, without being too loud or agressive. 



#### Responsiveness.

I wanted my portfolio to be responsive across various devices. The layout adjusts itself to different screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience, as per the requirements. 



#### Features and Components.

Compontents for the hero section, navigation bar, technologies, projects, about me, and contact.


#### Some things to note: 

I utilized a functional form with error handling for a smooth user interaction. I opted to also use a free service called Formspree to recieve my messages. The messages are sent to my email if you want to try it out. Additionally, there is a confirmation message after a successful form submission so limit the chance of someone sending a form multiple times. 

I configured the navigation bar with clear, accessible links and included icons for GitHub and LinkedIn and used smooth scrolling from the navigation bar.

My project images reveal descriptions on hover and made them fully responsive as well. Clicking the project will take you to the GitHub repo for that project.
